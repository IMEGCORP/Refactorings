### Open Ended Problem

### You have a list of 11 quarterback people
### You want to know, if you choose one at random, how many tries it will take to get N in a row
### Author a Python script that chooses one quarterback from the list,
### and then compares it to the previous choice. If the choice is the same,
### that is 2 choices in a row. If the quarterback people are the same,
### print the current choice, the previous choice, the number of tries it
### took to geth there, and how many in a row that choice is.

### Expected output to the terminal:
"""
Kirk ::: Kirk ::: Try 1427 ::: 2 in a row
Tom ::: Tom ::: Try 1432 ::: 2 in a row
Tom ::: Tom ::: Try 1433 ::: 3 in a row
Tom ::: Tom ::: Try 1434 ::: 4 in a row
It took 1435 tries to get 4 people in a row!
"""

### quarterback people
people = ['Patrick', 'Jared', 'Tua', 'Russell', 'Tom', 'Trevor', 'Matthew', 'Aaron', 'Kirk', 'Geno', 'Justin']

### TASK: choose the same person "people_in_a_row_target" number of times in a row


### CONSTRAINTS: the list and all inputs should be the only manually entered data
