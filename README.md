# C# refactoring and unit test exercises

Candidate C# Test #1:
- Clone repository to your local Git/IDE
- If you get "How are you planning to use this Fork?", enter "For my own purposes".  
- Switch to the 'Sprint1Refactor' branch and create a new branch called 'Refactor-\<Your Name\>' from it.  
- Open solution IDE you are most familiar with (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or VSCODE etc.).
- After nuget packages are restored, build the solution. Build output should show 3 unit test passing.  
  - `Test Count: 3, Passed: 3, Failed: 0, Warnings: 0, Inconclusive: 0, Skipped: 0`  
- Refactor the 'Refactorings\TicTacToe.cs' application/file - (no need to touch any other applications)
- Once refactored, compiled with no errors, and tests are passing, commit and push your branch changes back to the repository
- Open a pull request for your changes to be merged into the 'Sprint1Refactor' branch in the repro

Notes to Candidate:
- You can refactor this file anyway you would like. The only requirement is that the associated unit test passes all checks.
- An associated Unit test for this application can be found in the CSharpRefactoringTests project in the solution
- You may use any IDE you are most familiar with (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or VSCODE etc.)
- You will have up to 1 hour to complete the test
