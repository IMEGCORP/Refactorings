# C# refactoring and unit test exercises

Candidate C# Test #1:
- Clone repository to your local Git/IDE
- Open the 'develop' branch and create a new branch called 'Sprint1Refactor'
- Refactor the 'Refactorings\TicTacToe.cs' application/file - (no need to touch any other applications)
- Once refactored, compiled with no errors, and tests are passing, commit and push your branch changes back to the repository
- Open a pull request for your changes to be merged into the 'develop' branch in the repro

Notes to Candidate:
- You can refactor this file anyway you would like. The only requirement is that the associated unit test passes all checks.
- An associated Unit test for this application can be found in the CSharpRefactoringTests project in the solution
- You may use any IDE you are most familiar with (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or VSCODE etc.)
- You will have up to 1 hour to complete the test
