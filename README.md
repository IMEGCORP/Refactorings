# C# & Python refactoring and unit test exercises

Candidate C# Test #1:
- Clone repository to your local Git/IDE.
    - If you get "How are you planning to use this Fork?", enter "For my own purposes".  
- Switch to the 'ReadySetGo_TicTacToe' git branch and create a new git branch called 'Refactor-\<Your Name\>' from it.  
- Open solution IDE you are most familiar with (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or VSCODE etc.).
- Refactor the 'Refactorings\TicTacToe.cs' file.
    - No need to touch any other existing files. Adding/Modifying new files is fine if needed.
- Once refactored, compiled with no errors, commit and push your branch changes back to the repository.
- Open a pull request for your changes to be merged into the 'ReadySetGo_TicTacToe' branch in the repo.

Notes to Candidate:
- You can refactor this file anyway you would like. The only requirement is that the code runs and works as expected.
- You may use any IDE you are most familiar with (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, or VSCODE etc.).
- You will have up to 1 hour to complete the test.

Candidate Python Test #1:
- Clone repository to your local Git/IDE.
    - If you get "How are you planning to use this Fork?", enter "For my own purposes".
- Create a new branch off of 'main' and name it your LastName
- Open 'test1Original' and follow instructions within the file to completion.

Candidate Python Test #2:
- Open 'test2Original.py (on same branch you made earlier) and folow the instructions in the file to completion.
